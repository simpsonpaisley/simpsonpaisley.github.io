        <a id="skip" href="#cv">Skip to Qualifications </a>
        <p> Hi, I'm Paisley, and I am currently learning to develop websites. After studying Mechatronic Engineering at University, I found I didn't really enjoy the subject, and have since been working nights in Morrison's. <br>
           Whilst working, I have been looking for a skill I enjoy, and could hopefully turn into a job, this is when I tried web development, through a CodeCademy advert.<br> I found I really enjoyed this area, as although I had tried coding before, I prefer the more instant results from HTML and CSS. <br>
           Since then, I have been trying to improve my skills. Although I haven't been doing this for very long, and only have a very basic knowledge, I have really been enjoying throwing myself into making websites, and trying out new ideas and methods. </p>
        <h3 class="academic"> Hobbies and Interests </h3>
        <p> I have quite a few hobbies, which I lick to do in my spare time. I have recently started a vegetable patch in my garden, and am hoping to get some good vegetables from it later in the year. <br>
          I also enjoy going on bicycle rides round the countryside. I just bought a new road bike, which I'm still getting used to, but now I can go further much easier than I used to be able to. <br>
          One of my main interests is history, especially the Wars of the Roses, which I studied during A-Level History. I am also intersted in more recent history, and how it can relate to current events, and am currently reading a book about Clement Attlee </p>
